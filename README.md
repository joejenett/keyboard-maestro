<a href="Window Size Macros.kmmacros">Window Size Macros</a> (‘save link as’) is a set of macros for specifying the size of an active app’s frontmost window and centering it on the desktop. Also included is a macro for automatically resizing and recentering a changed window for an open app upon returning to that app from a different app - this macro allows you to define one or more apps it applies to. Be sure to modify the list of apps to your own needs before using. Theres also a macro for toggling the ‘automatic’ macro. Enjoy!
