## Window Size Macros
for resizing and centering the frontmost window  

Window Size Macros is a set of macros for specifying the size of an active app’s frontmost window and centering it on the desktop. Also included is a macro for automatically resizing and recentering a changed window upon returning to that app from a different app. You can define one or more apps it applies to. Be sure to modify the list of apps to your own needs before using. There’s also a macro for toggling automatic resizing and recentering.
### How I Use It

I spend a lot of time exploring websites and have my own preference when it comes to window size. Some sites don’t fit well and I end up enlarging the browser window to view them. The next time I reactivate my browser after having switched to a different app (typically my feed reader), its window will resize and recenter. Or if I'm still using the browser, I can click on the desktop (Finder), and then on the browser window again to resize and recenter it.
