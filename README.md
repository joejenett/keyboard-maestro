<h2>Window Size Macros</h2
for resizing and centering the frontmost window
  
<a href="Window Size Macros.kmmacros">Window Size Macros</a> (‘save link as’) is a set of macros for specifying the size of an active app’s frontmost window and centering it on the desktop. Also included is a macro for automatically resizing and recentering a changed window for an open app upon returning to that app from a different app - this macro allows you to define one or more apps it applies to. Be sure to modify the list of apps to your own needs before using. There’s also a macro for toggling the ‘automatic’ macro. 
<h3>How I Use It</h3>
I spend a lot of time exploring websites and have my own preference when it comes to window size. Some sites don’t fit well and I end up enlarging the window for them. The next time I want to return the window to my preferred size, I just click on the desktop, then on the window again.
